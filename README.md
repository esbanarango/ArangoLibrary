#Arango's Stuff
========

Implementation the library portal for my dad.

I'm making it using [Zend Framework](http://http://framework.zend.com/), MySql database, JQuery (with multiple plugins) and NetBeans 7.0.1 (:P) basically.
It's a simple portal where you can keep track of my father books. I'm using it to try, experiment and learn CSS3 and HTML5 tricks.

#####Â NetBeans for PHP ([About](http://netbeans.org/features/php/))
NetBeans offers a great sintax highlight and smart code completion for PHP, besides it recognizes a Zend project.
